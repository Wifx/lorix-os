or you (if you are acting on your own behalf) ("Licensee"), and on the other hand,
Atmel Corporation ("Atmel").

By installing or using any of the software downloaded or provided with these
terms ("Licensed Software"), you are indicating that you are binding Licensee
to the terms of this Agreement, and that you are duly authorized by Licensee to do so.
If you are not authorized to bind Licensee to the terms of this Agreement,
or if Licensee does not agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement,
do not install or use any such software.

FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.  ATMEL WILL HAVE
NO OBLIGATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO CORRECT ANY BUGS, DEFECTS OR ERRORS IN
THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, PROVIDE ANY UPDATES, UPGRADES OR NEW RELEASES OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE,

8.	High Risk Activities. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE
IS NOT DESIGNED OR APPROVED FOR, AND WILL NOT BE INCORPORATED (WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN
APPROVAL OF AN OFFICER OF ATMEL) INTO, ANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED OR DESIGNED TO BE USED
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACTIVITIES WHERE THE FAILURE OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD REASONABLY
BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN DEATH, BODILY INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
("HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES").  IN NO EVENT WILL ATMEL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO LICENSEE
OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IN CONNECTION
WITH HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES, AND ATMEL HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
FITNESS FOR ANY HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.

9.  	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
ATMEL BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY (WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER TORT THEORY, CONTRIBUTION, BREACH OF WARRANTY,
OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY) FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ATMEL has been advised
of or should have known of the possibility of such damages.

IN NO EVENT WILL ATMEL'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE
OR ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER UNDER CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,
CONTRIBUTION, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY) EXCEED THE GREATER OF
(A) THE AGGREGATE OF ALL LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEE TO ATMEL FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR

AND Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, ATMEL will not be liable for
ANY costs of PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY under any circumstances.

Each Party acknowledges that THE OTHER PARTY has entered into this agreement in reliance
on the limitations of liability, DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES
AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES contained in this AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS FORMS
AN ESSENTIAL AND fundamental part of the basis of the bargain BETWEEN THE PARTIES,
WITHOUT WHICH SUCH the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement.
EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SUCH PROVISIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY
FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

10.  	Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. This Agreement is to be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal laws of the State of California (as permitted by Section 1646.5
of the California Civil Code or any similar successor provision), without giving effect
to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the internal laws of the State of California to the rights and duties of the parties.
This Agreement will not be governed by the U.N. Convention on the Sale of Goods,
the application of which is expressly excluded. Except for actions for injunctive
or other equitable relief, which may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction,
all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California,
or if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and agree to submit to,
the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.

11. 	General. Licensee will not, and will have no right to, assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer (whether voluntarily, by operation of law or otherwise) this Agreement or any of
its rights or obligations hereunder to any third party without the prior written consent
of Atmel, and any purported assignment, delegation or other transfer without such consent
will have no force or effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon
and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
No failure of either party to enforce any right under this Agreement will be deemed a waiver
of such right or any other right under this Agreement. Any waiver by a party of a breach
of any provision of this Agreement by the other party hereunder will not be deemed to be
a waiver of any subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of any breach of any other
provision of this Agreement.
This Agreement may not be superseded, modified, or amended except in a writing signed by an officer
of each party. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal
or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the extent possible consistent
with the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in
full force and effect. This Agreement will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms
and without any strict construction against either party because it was drafted by such party
or for any other reason. This Agreement will constitute the entire agreement between the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof, and expressly supersedes and replaces all prior
and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, quotations, negotiations and communications, written
or oral, between the parties relating to such subject matter.

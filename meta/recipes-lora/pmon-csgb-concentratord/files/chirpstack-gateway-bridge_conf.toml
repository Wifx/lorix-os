# This configuration provides a Semtech UDP packet-forwarder backend and
# integrates with a MQTT broker. Many options and defaults have been omitted
# for simplicity.

# See https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/config/ for a full
# configuration example and documentation.

# Integration configuration.

  # Payload marshaler.
  #
  # This defines how the MQTT payloads are encoded. Valid options are:
  # * protobuf:  Protobuf encoding (this will become the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge v3 default)
  # * json:      JSON encoding (easier for debugging, but less compact than 'protobuf')
  marshaler="protobuf"

  # MQTT integration configuration.
  [integration.mqtt]

    # MQTT authentication.
    [integration.mqtt.auth]

      # Type defines the MQTT authentication type to use.
      #
      # Set this to the name of one of the sections below.
      type="generic"

      # Generic MQTT authentication.

# Filters.
#
# These can be used to filter LoRaWAN frames to reduce bandwith usage between
# the gateway and ChirpStack Gateway Bridge. Depending the used backend, filtering
# will be performed by the Packet Forwarder or ChirpStack Gateway Bridge.

  # NetIDs filters.
  #
  # The configured NetIDs will be used to filter uplink data frames.
  # When left blank, no filtering will be performed on NetIDs.
  #
  # Example:
  # net_ids=[
  #   "000000",
  #   "000001",
  # ]
  net_ids=[
  ]

  # JoinEUI filters.
  #
  # The configured JoinEUI ranges will be used to filter join-requests.
  # When left blank, no filtering will be performed on JoinEUIs.
  #
  # Example:
  # join_euis=[
  #   ["0000000000000000", "00000000000000ff"],
  #   ["000000000000ff00", "000000000000ffff"],
